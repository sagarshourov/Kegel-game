# Kegel Game Scoring System

This project is a **Laravel-based** backend system designed to manage a Kegel game tournament. It allows for player registration, score tracking, and generating a leaderboard. This demo provides a foundation to build a full-fledged scoring system with an easy-to-manage interface for organizing Kegel tournaments.

## Features

- **Player Management:** Add and manage player profiles.
- **Score Tracking:** Record player scores across different games.
- **Leaderboard:** Automatically generates a leaderboard based on player performance.
- **Tournament Management:** Handle multiple games and tournaments.

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have Composer installed, then run:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Set up environment:**

    Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Generate an application key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. **Configure the database:**

    Open the `.env` file and update the following fields with your database information:

    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=kegel_db
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

5. **Run migrations:**

    To create the necessary database tables, run:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6. **Serve the application:**

    Start the Laravel development server:
